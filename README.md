# Simulation of Multi-access Edge Computing envoronment in AnyLogic

In this project I simulated the performance and possibility to develop a driving
assistance Application with a Multi-Access-Edge Computing (MEC) network.  The simulation is developed with the [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/) personal learning edition framework, the pre-processing and post-processing steps are implemented with python.
All the details are described in the [Project Report](https://github.com/albertorumi/Simulation-of-MEC-envoronment-in-AnyLogic/blob/main/SimulationReport.pdf)
